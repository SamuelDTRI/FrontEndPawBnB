        Hello! My name is Allie and I am a recent college graduate. I am new to
        Meowtel but I am definitely not new to caring for cats! I have owned
        cats my entire life and have been petsitting since I was 10 years old.
        One of my cats was diabetic so I have experience with giving those
        injections. I am also used to mixing up medication and food to make the
        perfect meal for any cat! I currently work in downtown Manhattab during
        the day so I will not be available from roughly 9am-6pm on weekdays to
        care for your cat. I am available at any time most weekends. The times
        may vary based on where you live in Manhattan due to commuting times.
        Please feel free to reach out with any questions!
      </p>
    </div>
